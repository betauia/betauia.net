# Plans for Website

To have a clear path of what to do in the future, we have made a list of different things to focus on.

If you have any good ideas of what is needed, talk with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9X6W6v9RcE) and we can see if it should be added.

## User System

A way for students to log in and access tools that needs to make sure they are attending a related study.

## Content and Information

Students need good information on the sites to make them actually use it. Things like old exams, info about Beta, tips and tools, etc...

## Calendar

A system for students to know what is happening at UiA and in Beta. The calendar needs to be accessible and possible to filter out different events.

## Game Jams

Have all the old Game Jam games available to play one the website.

## Tools and Info

Different kinds of tools like pizza calculator, useful websites, projects, etc...

## Comedy Central

A joke and meme page for both students and developers to have fun with. Everything could be added here, from Arne Wiklund ASCII art to Kubernuts.
