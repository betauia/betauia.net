    <p class="paragraph">The rules are as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>Who can play?</strong> â€“ You play alone, no teams!
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>Who wins?</strong> â€“ The last player standing
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>Remember</strong> â€“ No cheating
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-red-600 italic text-2xl">Cheating or not following the rules will result in disqualification and immediate removal from the competition.</p>


    <h2 class="section-title">How it works?</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Players are dropped into a world with chests scattered across the map, some in the center and others around the map. 
      The goal is to fight other players in PvP battles, with the last remaining player (or team) being the winner. 
      As the game progresses, the area shrinks, pushing players closer together.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">When?</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">ðŸ“¢ The competition starts on Sunday 21st at 16:00</p> 
  </Tournament>
