    <h2 class="section-title">Criteria for competing</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">In order to compete there are some basic criteria that you must meet:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>1</strong> – You have to own Minecraft
      </li><li class="list-item">
        <strong>2</strong> – Look at number 1
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="paragraph">You can also borrow a friend's account if you don't have one yourself.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Scoring</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      For each game, there will be a scoring system. Generally, if the game has a built-in scoring system of some 
      kind, that will be the one that will be considered. A contestant's ranking in each individual game will be used to determine the
      amount of points the contestant gets on the overall leaderboard. To add more stakes to the games, for each game that passes, 
      a multiplier gets added to each player's final score, starting from 1x and increasing by 0.5 each time. As such, the later 
      rounds will be more important in determining the winners.
    </p>
