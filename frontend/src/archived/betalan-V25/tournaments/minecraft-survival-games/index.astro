    <h2 class="section-title">Rules</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">The rules are as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>Who can play?</strong> â€“ You can either play solo or in team
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>Who wins?</strong> â€“ The last man/team standing
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <strong>Remember</strong> â€“ No cheating
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">How it works?</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Players are dropped into a world with chests scattered across the map, some in the center and others around the map. 
      The goal is to fight other players in PvP battles, with the last remaining player (or team) being the winner. 
      As the game progresses, the area shrinks, pushing players closer together.
