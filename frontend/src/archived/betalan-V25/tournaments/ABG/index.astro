    <h2 class="section-title">Criteria for competing</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">In order to compete you must have access to a Minecraft account. Be it your own or a willing friend's account. Thats all. 
    Other than that citeria, there are no other limits</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Scoring</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      For each game there is a predetermined scoring system. A player's ranking in a game will determine how many points they get 
      that round. Each round, all scores get an increasing multiplier that starts at 1 and increases by 0.5 for each game played, 
      meaning that later games will count more. After each round, players will vote on which game to play next, so if you are 
      really good at one game, you want to save that until the end. In the end, a final surpirse game is played. Good luck gamers!
