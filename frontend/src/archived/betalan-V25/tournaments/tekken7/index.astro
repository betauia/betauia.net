    <h2 class="section-title">Do You Have What It Takes to Rule the Iron Fist?</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Are you prepared to show your might at the BetaLAN tournament? Whether you're a rising underdog or a seasoned warrior, this is your stage.
      The only question is...

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Can you survive the King of Iron Fist? ðŸ‘Šâš¡
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Criteria</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">The tournament will be driven by these rules:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li class="list-item">
        Each player will play against each other in a best of 3 format, until top 8.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Both players will choose their characters, and every round will be played on a random stage.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        The winner of the round has to stay at the character they won with,
        and the opponent gets to switch characters if they choose to.
      </li>

      <li class="list-item">
        After each set, the winner has to approach the TO's table with the results.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Since the tournament is run on a double-bracket, a lost set will move the loser over to the losers bracket,
        and another loss will remove any opportunity to progress further into the tournament.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        There will be prizes for the top three winners.
      </li>
    </ul>
