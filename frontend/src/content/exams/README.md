# How to add exams

## Folder structure

Under the `exams/` folder, every single subdirectory should be named by their subject code, for example `exams/ma178` and `exams/ma179`. This is where all the exams should be stored and it is ignored in git. Every subject on the page is loaded from these folders.

## Naming exams

Exams should be named with the following syntax inside their subject's folder: `year-part-score.pdf`

Examples:

- `exams/ma178/2021-3-56.pdf`
- `exams/ma179/2024-1-100.pdf`
- `exams/ma179/2023-2-69.pdf`
